## reflication

This operation went relatively smoothly. Since it was the first time to use outside sources to edit a web page, I didn't know 

how to insert images in index.md at the beginning, so I spent some time trying, and finally asked Ben to help me solve it. 

Through this assignment, I know how to add pictures and text to markdown files, and how to complete a static web page with 11TY. 
 
However, there are still some problems I need to solve. For example, I need to learn how to use div. I can skillfully use div in 

regular web page editing, but when images are added through index.md, I can't use div in index.html. I tried it a few times, but 

it didn't work in the end. In addition, I need to be efficient in editing web pages, and I'm always hesitant to write code.

## Action

In order to make my web page unique, I am still trying how to edit pictures separately. Next stage, I will seek help from 

related learning websites and videos to solve the above problems
